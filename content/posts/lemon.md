Lemons are everywhere.  When you buy a used car you can look for rust and bald tires, but how do you spot a financial lemon?

There are three simple steps:

1. Don't invest in companies you don't understand.  Every company has documents explaining how they make money.  If it doesn't make sense to you then don't invest in it.
2. Watch out for companies that promise returns.  All investing involves risk.  Any company that guarantees returns can't guarantee returns.
3. Never invest in a pyramid scheme.  If a company needs you to bring in other investors to make it work then run.
