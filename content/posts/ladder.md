Your first financial goal can’t be a big house, a yacht, or a fast car.  Those are nice, but they can come later.  Your first financial goal is to sleep well at night.

Financial freedom doesn’t mean buying anything you want.  It means being free from worry.  It means knowing that you’re OK.  That your bills won’t overwhelm you and that you're living well without living in debt.

Slow and Steady is a system to build your financial freedom one step at a time.  There’s nothing new here.  Just a simple set of steps that you could follow to build your financial freedom slowly and consistently so money turns into something you don’t have to worry about.
