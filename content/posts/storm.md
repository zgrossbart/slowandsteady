There are only three guaranteed ways to make money in the stock market:

1. Get lucky
1. Cheat
1. Be large enough to make your own weather

Luck is hard to come by.  Even the smartest hedge fund managers eventually run out of luck.  Look at famous fund managers like [Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb).  As smart as they are, their luck only lasts so long.

Cheating is risky.  Trading on insider information or attempting to control markets just isn't worth it.  Your chances of getting caught are just too hight.

Making your own weather is impossible for an individual.  You can only do that if you're a giant financial institution trading billions.
