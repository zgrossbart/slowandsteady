We all know that saving money is important.  You need to keep something back for a rainy day and for retirement.  But how much money should you save?

This is a tricky question because there’s no simple right answer.  Unforeseen expenses are going to happen.  Your sink will explode, your washing machine will melt down, and you’re going to back your car into that dumpster at the end of your parking lot.  It just happens.

The key is to find a good overall goal.  You’re going to skip some months, but you need to get back on pace in the next month.  The key is slow and steady consistency.
