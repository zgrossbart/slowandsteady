<p>Not all debt is a bad thing, but you have to find your financial balance.  When you have controlled debt like a mortgage you can find balance in your monthly budget.  When you have uncontrolled debt like a credit card then you’ll never find your financial balance.</p>

<p>So how can you tell the difference between controlled and uncontrolled debt?  It all comes down to interest.</p>

<p>With a mortgage you’re buying back a little bit of your home every month.  One tile in your kitchen or one floorboard in your bedroom; you own your home piece by piece.</p>

<p>Credit cards encourage you to just pay the interest.  That means you aren’t getting out of debt at all.  You’re just paying them a fee everything month for holding your debt.</p>
